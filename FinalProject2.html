      Dome Keeper is a tower defense game with roguelike elements. <br />
      Players control a character managing a glass dome, which acts as their
      spacecraft. <br />
      After the spacecraft crashes down onto an extraterrestrial landscape, the
      player must defend their dome from the native aliens intent on destroying
      it. <br />
      The player character moves around using a jetpack, and can mine through
      the ground using a drill. <br />
      The main resources that the player must acquire are iron, cobalt, and
      water, which can be mined for beneath the dome and spent on upgrades.
      <br />
      A timer indicates the amount of time left before the next wave of enemies,
      and the character must return to the dome with as many resources as
      possible before the aliens arrive and begin damaging it. <br />
      The main weapons the player uses to fight are a laser beam that rotates
      around the dome, or a sword-like appendage that can be extended to hit
      enemies. <br />
      Both weapons can be improved to have greater damage or attack strength,
      while the character can also spend resources on themselves to increase
      their movement speed or drill power. <br />
      The goal of the player in the default game mode "Relic Hunt" is to fight
      off the waves of enemies and continue mining for resources in-between,
      while digging deep enough to find an ancient relic used to eradicate the
      aliens.
