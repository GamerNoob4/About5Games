      Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by
      Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and play games
      created by other users. <br />
      Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006,
      the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the
      programming language Lua. <br />
      For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform
      and as a company. <br />
      Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this
      growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
      Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual
      currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million
      monthly active users, including more than half of all American children
      under 16. <br />
      Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it
      has faced criticism for its moderation and microtransactions and
      accusations of exploitative practices directed toward children.
