      Bloons TD 6 is a tower defense game played from a 2.5D perspective, as
      opposed to the 2D perspective of previous Bloons Tower Defense games, and
      utilizes 3D computer graphics. In the game, the player—who is able to team
      up with up to three other players in a co-op mode—creates a defense
      consisting of several variants of skilled monkeys, structures, and traps,
      in order to prevent balloon-like objects known as "Bloons" from reaching
      an exit. Bloons TD 6 introduces a new category of monkeys, known as
      "heroes", which level up and become stronger either over time, or through
      the player using in-game currency to increase their level. Monkeys each
      play a different role, and can affect Bloons in several ways, including
      popping them, slowing them down, or boosting the power of other monkeys.
      When destroyed, Bloons grant the player money, which can be used to
      purchase additional defenses or upgrade existing ones—upgraded monkeys
      gain access to new abilities. As the player pops more Bloons each round,
      the player and all active towers gradually earn XP every round, which help
      unlock new upgrades and other features as the player continues to play the
      game. Bloons spawn in several waves, and travel along a predetermined
      path. Sets of waves are separated into rounds, each of which consists of a
      set amount of Bloons, which over time become stronger and may have
      properties resistant to certain effects, such as explosions, ice, or fire,
      with some being immune to more than one. The largest bloons are referred
      to as "MOAB class" bloons, which are designed as blimps and zeppelins, are
      harder to defeat than other bloons due to having more health than most
      other bloons. If a bloon gets through the player's defenses, the player
      loses lives, stronger bloons taking away more lives. If the player loses
      all their lives, the game ends. If the player can complete all the
      required rounds without losing all their lives, the player will win. After
      winning, the player has the option to exit directly back to the home
      screen, or go into an endless Freeplay mode, which doesn't end until the
      player loses. Each round is played on a specific map, and can be played on
      several difficulty options. Some maps contain obstacles that will prevent
      monkeys from shooting at bloons in front of the offending area (some of
      which can be removed for a set amount of cash). The player can earn
      several in-game currencies through gameplay: "Monkey Money" is rewarded
      for winning rounds or completed challenges and allows for additional
      features to be unlocked in the game, "Monkey Knowledge Points" are granted
      throughout gameplay and can be used to permanently upgrade monkeys via a
      skill tree, and "Trophies" are a rare type of currency only obtainable
      through weekly events, used to unlock cosmetics. Boss Bloons are a type of
      special event in the game, which were introduced in Bloons TD 5. In these
      events, players must prepare for a Boss Bloon, a very powerful MOAB class
      bloon with large amounts of health. The boss will appear first at round
      40, and appears every 20 rounds after that, its health increasing each
      time. These bosses have special abilities, such as summoning recently
      popped bloons, speeding up regular bloons, or become immune to certain
      monkey types. There are 5 boss bloons, Bloonarius, Lych, Vortex,
      Dreadbloon, and Phayze. Created at the same time as bosses, Paragons were
      built as their counter. Being some of the most expensive tower upgrades,
      they combine each of the tower's 3 paths into one much more powerful
      upgrade. The Paragons are some of the most powerful towers in the games,
      and especially excel against bosses due to a damage buff against them.
      There are currently 6 Paragons, the Apex Plasma Master (Dart Monkey),
      Glaive Dominus (Boomerang Monkey), Ascended Shadow (Ninja Monkey), Navarch
      of the Seas (Monkey Buccaneer), Master Builder (Engineer Monkey), Goliath
      Doomship (Monkey Ace), and Magus Perfectus (Wizard Monkey).
