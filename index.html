      Classic Mario side-scrolling gameplay is turned on its head with the
      addition of Wonder Flowers. <br />
      These game-changing items trigger spectacular moments you have to see to
      believe...<br />
      Witness pipes coming alive, wreak havoc as a giant spiky ball, and see
      even more unexpected events called Wonder Effects.<br />

      Super Mario Bros. Wonder is an upcoming 2D Super Mario game for the
      Nintendo Switch. It was first announced during the June 21, 2023 Nintendo
      Direct, and is planned to be released worldwide on October 20, 2023.
      <br />
      The game features an art style reminiscent of the New Super Mario Bros.
      games, as well as new power-ups, including the Wonder Flower. Mario,
      Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Yoshis of different colors, and
      Yellow Toad are playable characters. <br />
      It is the first new full-fledged 2D Mario game since New Super Mario Bros.

      Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a side-scrolling platform game. <br />
      As one of six player characters—Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess
      Daisy, Toad, and Yoshi—the player completes levels across the Flower
      Kingdom with assistance from its talking flower-like denizens. <br />
      Similar to prior Super Mario games, players guide their character to the
      end of a level while avoiding enemies (such as Goombas and Piranha Plants)
      and transporting through Warp Pipes. <br />
      Each stage contains multiple collectible "Wonder Seeds". The game supports
      local multiplayer for up to four players.<br />
      New power-ups include a fruit that transforms the player into an elephant
      and the Wonder Flower, which triggers bizarre effects such as pipes coming
      to life, hordes of enemies spawning, and character appearances
      altering.<br />
      <span style="font-size: x-small">From © Wikipedia</span><br /><br />
      The new Super Mario Bros. Wonder looks like a fairly radical departure
      from the last run of 2D Mario games that we received - from a visual
      perspective, at least. <br />
      Nintendo looks to be leveraging the power of the Switch to deliver more
      detailed environments, redesigned character models, and more intricate
      level outlays which make inventive use of new mechanics and returning
      powerups. <br />
      What's key to understand from the initial batch of Super Mario Bros.
      <br />
      Wonder gameplay is the amount of creativity being poured into play. <br />
      A lot of this stems from the new Wonder Flowers, a collectible you'll need
      to acquire through levels which can unlock the wonders of the world.
      <br />
      For example, we've seen characters transform into new items (such as a
      ball which can quickly whip through environments), Mario's neck lengthen
      into the sky, the shape of pipes contort as they come to life, and even
      the lighting of levels changing entirely. <br />
      It adds a lot of flair and unpredictability to courses.<br />
      Nintendo is also injecting a little more personality into Super Mario
      Bros. Wonder. <br />
      There's a real playful tone throughout, with evocative sound effects and
      talking flowers helping to propel the characters on as we see them swim up
      waterfalls, grind on rails, and do their best to avoid roller-skating
      Koopas. Classic.<br />
