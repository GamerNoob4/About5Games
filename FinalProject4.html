      Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was
      created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
      Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public
      in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch
      stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft
      is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies
      sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021. It has been
      ported to several platforms. In Minecraft, players explore a blocky,
      procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite
      terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items,
      and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen
      game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or
      compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a
      survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the
      world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have
      unlimited resources and access to flight). The game's large community also
      offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications,
      servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game
      mechanics and possibilities. Minecraft has received critical acclaim,
      winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video
      games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and
      the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the
      game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach
      chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang
      and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for
      US$2.5 billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including
      Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and the most
      recent release Minecraft Legends.
